Hello Prarthan,

I acknowledge the receipt of your mail. Please go through the following points:

1. The domain name has been noted and will be activated on approval of the design.
2. The pages mentioned will get ready within the stipulated timeline.
3. You may provide the content by 23rd July. However, it could really help if some gist about the company and its nature of business be provided today itself, which will in turn facilitate in creation of the demo designs of the website.
4. Once the content is received, it will be easy to accumulate the required images.
5. The two email addresses mentioned will be confirued as per the requirements.
6. When talking about maintainence, I'd like to mention the add ons that will be covered in the same.
	a) Web administration
	b) Email Support
	c) Two major changes (addition and removal of pages)
	d) Minor changes (changes with respect to text and images)
	e) Problem solving (server issues, and error resolutions)
7. A draft of the logo is ready and also attached with this mail. Please review the same.

I'll shortly share with you a few sample designs once I get the basic content to start with. 

Looking forward to receiving the required data so as to proceed with the work.

Thanks and regards,
